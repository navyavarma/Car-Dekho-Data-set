## Objective:
In this project, i'm trying to analyse and visualize the used car prices from the dataset, to predict the most probable car prices with the use of basic linear regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.
The aim is to develop a good regression model to offer accurate prediction of car price.

## Dataset Description:
This dataset contains information about used cars. We are going to use for finding predictions of price with the use of regression models.

The datasets consist of several features include:
Car_Name : This column should be filled with the name of the car.

Year : This column should be filled with the year in which the car was bought.

Kms_Driven : This is the distance completed by the car in km.

Fuel_Type : Fuel type of the car i.e Diesel,Petrol,CNG

Seller_Type : Defines whether the seller is a dealer or an individual.

Transmission : Defines whether the car is manual or automatic.

Owner : Defines the number of owners the car has previously had.

Selling_Price : This column should be filled with the price the owner wants to sell the car at (Independent Variable).
